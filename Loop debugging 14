Problem Statement
Given an integer N, your task is to print all the even integer from 1 to N.

Input
User task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the functions For_Loop() that takes the integer n as a parameter.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100

Note:
But there is a catch here given user function has already code in it which may or may not be correct, now you need to figure out these and correct if it is required

Output
Print all the even numbers from 1 to n.



public static void For_Loop(int n){
           for(int i=2;i<=n;i+=2){
           System.out.print(i+" ");
        //    i+=2;
       }
}
