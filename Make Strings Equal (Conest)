Problem Statement
You are given two strings S1 and S2 of length N. You need to make those strings equal by replacing any index in string S1 with any character. The cost incurred is as follows:
You pay X units for the first replacement, you do not pay anything for the second replacement, you pay X units for the third replacement, you do not pay anything for the fourth replacement, and so on.

Find the total units you need to pay to make S1 equal to S2.


Input
The first line of the input contains two integers, N and X.
The second and third lines of the input contain strings S1 and S2 respectively.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 200000
1 <= X <= 100
S1 and S2 contain lowercase characters of the english alphabet.


Output
Output a single integer, the number of units we need to pay.
