Problem Statement
Sara is fond of ice- cream initially she had N icecreams with her. If Sara eats exactly half of the ice cream she has in a day and the remaining icecreams get tripled each night. How many ice creams does Sara have at the end of D days?

Note:- Take floor value while dividing by 2.

Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function Icecreams() that takes integers N and D as parameters.

Constraints:-
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= D <= 20


Output
Return a single integer denoting the number of ice creams at the end of D days.


static int Icecreams (int N, int D){
//Enter your code here
while(D>0){
    N = N - N/2;
    N = N*3;
    
    D--;
}
return N;

}
