Problem Statement
Given a number N, you need to check whether the given number is Palindrome or not. A number is said to be Palindrome when it reads the same from backward as forward.

Input
User task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about the input. You just have to complete the function isPalindrome() which contains N as a parameter.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 9999


Output
You need to return "True" is the number is palindrome otherwise "False".


def isPalindrome(N):
    tres= str(N)==str(N)[::-1]
    return tres
