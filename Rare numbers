Problem Statement
A number s called rare if all of its digits are divisible by K. Given a number N your task is to check if the given number is rare or not.

Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function Rare() that takes integer N and K as arguments.

Constraints:-
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= K <= 9

Output
Return 1 if the given number is rare else return 0.



static int Rare(int N, int K){
//Enter your code here
while(N>0){
    int rem = N%10;
    if(rem%K != 0){
        return 0;
    }
    N = N/10;
}

return 1;

}
