Loki performs his revenge prank until and unless 1 survivor remains.
What is the initial position of the survivor, if the indexing is clockwise?



Input
The first line of input contains a single integer T. The next T line of input contains Two space separated integers each containing value of N and k.


Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= k, N <= 20


Output
Print the initial position of the survivor.
