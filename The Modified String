Problem Statement
Ishaan is playing with strings these days. He has found a new string. He wants to modify it as per the following rules:

1. The string should not have three consecutive same characters (Refer example for explanation).
2. He can add any number of characters anywhere in the string.
Find the minimum number of characters which Ishaan must insert in the string.


Input
First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a string S consisting of lowercase English Alphabets.

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Length of S <= 1000


Output
For each test case, in a new line, print the minimum number of characters which Ishaan must insert in the string.

        int i = 0;
        while (i < n - 2)
        {
            if (str.charAt(i) == str.charAt(i + 1) &&
                str.charAt(i) == str.charAt(i + 2))

                cnt++;
