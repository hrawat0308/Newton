Problem Statement
There are N buildings in a row with different heights H[i] (1 <= i <= N).
You are viewing the buildings from the left and you can see the roof of a building i if no building to the left of the ith building has a height greater than the ith building.
You are asked to find the number of buildings whose roofs you can see.


Input
The first line contains N denoting number of buildings.
The next line contains N space seperated integers denoting heights of the buildings from left to right.


Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= H[i] <= 1000000000000000


Output
The output should contain one integer which is the number of buildings whose roofs you can see.
